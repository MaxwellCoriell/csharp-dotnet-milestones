#Bangazon with API  and AngularJS

## Requirements

In ASP.NET 4.6 and/or APS.NET 5 Create an API app that:

 *Implepents GET, POST, PUT and DELETE of animals in your zoo
* Create a front-end, AngularJS project that: 
	* Manages CRUD operations on customers
	* Manages CRUD operations on products
	* Manages CRUD operations on payment options
	* Manages CRUD operations on orders
	* Add/remove products from orders
	* Make sure your orders can be marked complete so user knows which ones are active and which ones aren't
* Add/remove products from orders
* Make sure your orders can be marked complete so user knows which ones are active and which ones aren't

## Stretch Goals

* Add photos of the products and display those photos along with the other information about each animal
* Validate user input using data annotations
* Make your page pretty, whatever that means to you. Get creative and use css and bootstrap to customize the way you display information. As an extra challenge, see if you can make the display dependant on the information that's being sent back from the server, i.e. all animals who live in aqautic habits have their name displayed in blue, or the word "carnivore" is always displayed in **bold**
