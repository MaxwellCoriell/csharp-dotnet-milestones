#Zoolandia with API and AngularJS

## Requirements

In ASP.NET 4.6 and/or APS.NET 5 Create an API app that:

* Implepents GET, POST, PUT and DELETE of animals in your zoo
* Create a front-end, AngularJS project that implements these methods to display a list of animals, add, edit and delete animals from the database.

## Stretch Goals

* Add photos of zoo animals and display those photos along with the other information about each animal
* Validate user input using data annotations
* Group animals by habitats and display accordingly
* Add zoo employees and assign them to habitats
* Make your page pretty, whatever that means to you. Get creative and use css and bootstrap to customize the way you display information. As an extra challenge, see if you can make the display dependant on the information that's being sent back from the server, i.e. all animals who live in aqautic habits have their name displayed in blue, or the word "carnivore" is always displayed in **bold**
