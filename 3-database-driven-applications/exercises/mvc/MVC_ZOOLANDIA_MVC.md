# Zoolandia With MVC

## Requirements

Create an MVC CRUD app that:

* Displays information on all of the animals in your zoo
* Allows you to add new animals to your zoo
* Allows you to edit animals currently in your zoo
* Allows you to delete animals from your zoo

## Stretch Goals

* Allow users to upload photos of zoo animals and display those photos along with the other information about each animal
* Validate user input using data annotations
* Make your page pretty, whatever that means to you. Get creative and use css and bootstrap to customize the way you display information. As an extra challenge, see if you can make the display dependant on the information that's being sent back from the server, i.e. all animals who live in aqautic habits have their name displayed in blue, or the word "carnivore" is always displayed in **bold**
