* List the total bill and mailing address for the following customers with an id of (10, 38, 57)
* Create an action that outputs a view that displays your your concert wishlist. You will need to create a class that will hold information regarding concerts you would like to attend. Create a list containing your concerts of choice. Set up several properties. Query your favorite concert list. You may want to create a table in your database or create the data on the fly.
