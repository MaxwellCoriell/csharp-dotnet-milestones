# Working with databases in Visual Studio

1. Visit the [SQL Server 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42295) download page and select *ENU\x64\SharedManagementObjects.msi*. Then install.
1. Restart Visual Studio if you have it open.
1. Right-click you project.
1. Select Add > New Item
1. Choose *Service-based database* from the list.
1. Type in the name of your database you want to create in SQL Server Express.
1. Click *Add* button.
1. Once the database appears in your Solution Explorer panel, double-click it. It will open up the Server Explorer panel and display your database under the *Data Connections* node.
1. Expand your database.

Now you can open the MSDN article ["Create a SQL database by using a designer"](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms233763.aspx#BKMK_CreateNewTbls) to walk through creating tables, foreign keys, and adding data.

> **Note:** You can get the connection string to the database by right-clicking the DB in the Solution Explorer, and selecting *Properties*.
