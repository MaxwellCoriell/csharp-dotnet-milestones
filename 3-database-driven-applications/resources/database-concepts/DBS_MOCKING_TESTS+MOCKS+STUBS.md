# TESTS

### Testing
* Test one method at a time - it goes in // Action of test.
* Need to come up with // Assert.
* Figuring out how to // Arrange is the hard part (to get it to run).

## MOCKS

Why Moq?  It isolates unit tests which are run in a random order and will modify DB if it is not isolated for the test.

#### Stub methods
When using Moq DB, if method() is called, don't execute full method - just return fake data.
