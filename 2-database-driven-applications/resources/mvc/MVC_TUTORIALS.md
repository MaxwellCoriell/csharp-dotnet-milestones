#Pluralsight (and other) Tutorials#

##Recommended:

1. Building a Web App with ASP.NET 5, MVC 6, EF 7, and angularjs
(https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aspdotnet-5-ef7-bootstrap-angular-web-app/table-of-contents)
9h21m by Shawn Wildermuth 11/3/2015
	- In all fairness, I didn't watch all 9 hours... but this one seems like a great resource. It's up-to-date, and might even use newer versions of tech than we're usng in class.
	- Will be most helpful in milstones 2 & 3
1. Getting Started with ASP.NET MVC 6 (AKA Movie History, all over again)
(https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc.html)
Online tutorial without video. Probably about 5h. Updated late 2015, early 2016.
	- Involves some copy/pasting without fully explaining code
	- Pro: You'll end up with a working app you can reference
	- Con: You might not understand why it works
	- NOTE: Will only work if you have all of the necessary updates installed
	- Will be most  helpful in milestones 2 & 3

##Not Recommended
1. Pretty much everything else. When deciding if a tutorial or resource is worth your time, consider the following factors:
	- Date: make sure the publication date is fairly recent (within the last year or two). Code changes quckly and out-of-date materials won't be very useful
	- Versions: If the versions of Visual Studio, SQL, ASP.NET, MVC, etc are not the same as the ones we're using in class, the information may or may not be useful to you
