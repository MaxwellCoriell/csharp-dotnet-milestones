## DotNetKoans Exercise
This exercise walks you through major concepts in C# and dotnet while introducing you to basic testing by  having you complete small steps to make a test pass.  Nobody likes this exersize, but it is an important step in leaning a new language.  

Koans are a series of puzzels designed to teach the contructs of the language.  Some people understand the structure of the koans faster than others. If you don't understand ask for help.  The main point is that you learn the basic rules of the language and not just go through and get the tests to pass.  These will be a reference as you continue to learn C#.


###Getting Started
* Fork the github project from:https://github.com/nashville-software-school/CSharpDotNetKoans
* Use git bash shell to clone the repo into the directory of your choosing (think "workspaces")
* Open the project in Visual Studio by opening the directory in file explorer and double-clicking on DotNetKoans.Sln (this is the project's solution file)
* Go to `Build > Build Solutions`. It should run without errors.
* When the project builds successfully click on Test -> Run -> All Tests
* There should be 155 failed tests in the Test Explorere window on the left
* Look in the NSS_Koans_Tester project in Solution Explorer (View -> Solution Explorer if it is not already open) for a numbered list of test files.
* Start with 1_Asserts.cs and modify the test to make it pass.  Note: you can run a single test or group of tests by right clicking on them and seleceting Run Selected Tests.
* The test files are numbered in a recommended order, but you can do them in any order.  They are not dependent on the other tests.
