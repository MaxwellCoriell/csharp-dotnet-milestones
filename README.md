# C\# & .NET Framework Mastery Curriculum

Welcome to the Nashville Software School C# and Microsoft .NET curriculum. You will be using the latest tools available from Microsoft that allow for cross-platform development - [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - and the traditional Windows-only tools.

Don't worry if you don't have a Windows PC. We will provide you with a Windows license, and the tools to create a virtual machine in which it can run.

## What is C\#?

A strongly typed, object oriented via classes, declarative and functional language in the .NET ecosystem that runs on the Common Language Runtime (CLR).


## .NET Framework

The .NET Framework consists of the [common language runtime](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8bs2ecf4(v=vs.110).aspx) (CLR) and the [.NET Framework class library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg145045(v=vs.110).aspx).

The common language runtime is the foundation of the .NET Framework. You can think of the runtime as an agent that manages code at execution time, providing core services such as memory management, thread management, and remoting, while also enforcing strict type safety and other forms of code accuracy that promote security and robustness. In fact, the concept of code management is a fundamental principle of the runtime. Code that targets the runtime is known as managed code, while code that does not target the runtime is known as unmanaged code.

The class library is a comprehensive, object-oriented collection of reusable types that you can use to develop applications ranging from traditional command-line interfaces, to APIs.
