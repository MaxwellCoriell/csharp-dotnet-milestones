# Database Migrations Exercise

1. For your models for Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or Trello, use Entity Framework migrations to create your database.
2. For your company, implement the ERD and Models for the added feature of direct messaging between users.
3. Do an Entity Framework migration for the change.

NOTE: At the end of this exercise you should have two (or more if you make more changes) migrations in your project. Don't do the steps out of order to avoid doing the second migration. Don't delete your mingrations.
