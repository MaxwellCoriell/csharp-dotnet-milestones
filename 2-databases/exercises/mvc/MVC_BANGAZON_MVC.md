# Bangazon With MVC

## Requirements

Create an MVC CRUD app that:

* Manages CRUD operations on customers
* Manages CRUD operations on products
* Manages CRUD operations on payment options
* Manages CRUD operations on orders
* Add/remove products from orders
* Make sure your orders can be marked complete so user knows which ones are active and which ones aren't

## Stretch Goals

* Allow users to upload photos of products
* Validate user input using data annotations
* Make your page pretty, whatever that means to you. Get creative and use css and bootstrap to customize the way you display information. As an extra challenge, see if you can make the display dependant on the information that's being sent back from the server, i.e. all animals who live in aqautic habits have their name displayed in blue, or the word "carnivore" is always displayed in **bold**
